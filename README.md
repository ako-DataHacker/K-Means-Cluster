# K-Means-Cluster
This is my version of K-Means Cluster using Jaccard distance as the metric for recentering the clusters.

I wrote this assignment using the Colab notebook in Google, and uploaded the text file there

as well. If run with a different compiler, you will need to change the file path.

Text File: The text file used is the first one in the health folder, bbchealth.txt

I have provided both the txt file, the ipynb, and py files.
